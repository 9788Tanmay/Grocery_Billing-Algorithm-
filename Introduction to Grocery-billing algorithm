# Grocery_Billing-Algorithm-
This was a project based on building a billing system for grocery stores by utilising the advantages of linked lists over arrays summed up as follows:
(1) The size of the arrays is fixed: So we must know the upper limit on the number of elements in advance. Also, generally, the allocated memory is equal to the upper 
limit irrespective of the usage, and in practical uses, the upper limit is rarely reached.

(2) Inserting a new element in an array of elements is expensive because a room has to be created for the new elements and to create room existing elements have to be shifted.
So Linked list provides the following two advantages over arrays
1) Dynamic size
2) Ease of insertion/deletion
Following are the important functions used in this project:
 1)Insert item
 2)Delete item
 3)Display Balance in the wallet and expenses
 4)Voucher
 5)Discount
